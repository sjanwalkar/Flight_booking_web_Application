# Flight_booking_web_Application
Implemented a Flight booking Dynamic Web Application using JSP, Servlet, JDBC and PostgreSQL databases, designed relational schema, ER-Diagram from scratch with SQL DDL queries.

Created an application that allows user to store, manipulate and query the RDBMS using JSP, Servlet and JDBC, by designing a
database/relationship schema, SQL scripting (using DDL & DML) that generates database in PostgreSQL. Allowing user to check flight schedule (filter it based on price, location and date), book/cancel flights and enter card details for payment etc which is achieved by SQL commands to extract data based on various filters.
